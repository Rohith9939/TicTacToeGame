**Tic Tac Toe Game**  This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. 
The game allows a human player to play against an AI opponent.  
## Features  - **Human vs. AI Gameplay**: The game supports a player-versus-computer mode where a human player competes against an AI opponent. 
**Randomized AI Moves**: The AI opponent makes randomized moves within the available empty spaces on the board.  
**Win Detection**: The game detects when either player achieves a win by forming a line of three consecutive marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
**Draw Detection**: If no player wins and the board is full, the game declares a draw. 
**Simple Console Interface**: The game interface is text-based, running in the console.  
## How to Play  1. Run the `LaunchGame.java` file to start the game. 2. Enter the row and column numbers when prompted to make your move. The board is indexed from 0 to 2. 3. The game will alternate between the human player and the AI player until a win or draw condition is met.  
## Getting Started  To run the game locally, follow these steps:  1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. 3. Compile and run the `LaunchGame.java` file.
